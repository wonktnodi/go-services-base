/*
Package pat is a URL-matching domain-specific language for Goji.


Quick Reference

The following table gives an overview of the language this package accepts. See
the subsequent sections for a more detailed explanation of what each pattern
does.

	Pattern			Matches			Does Not Match

	/			/			/hello

	/hello			/hello			/hi
							/hello/

	/user/:name		/user/carl		/user/carl/photos
				/user/alice		/user/carl/
							/user/

	/:file.:ext		/data.json		/.json
				/info.txt		/data.
				/data.tar.gz		/data.json/download

	/user/*			/user/			/user
				/user/carl
				/user/carl/photos


Static Paths

Most URL paths may be specified directly: the pattern "/hello" matches URLs with
precisely that path ("/hello/", for instance, is treated as distinct).

Note that this package operates on raw (i.e., escaped) paths (see the
documentation for net/url.URL.EscapedPath). In order to match a character that
can appear escaped in a URL path, use its percent-encoded form.


Named Matches

Named matches allow URL paths to contain any value in a particular path segment.
Such matches are denoted by a leading ":", for example ":name" in the rule
"/user/:name", and permit any non-empty value in that position. For instance, in
the previous "/user/:name" example, the path "/user/carl" is matched, while
"/user/" or "/user/carl/" (note the trailing slash) are not matched. Pat rules
can contain any number of named matches.

Named matches set URL variables by comparing pattern names to the segments they
matched. In our "/user/:name" example, a request for "/user/carl" would bind the
"name" variable to the value "carl". Use the Param function to extract these
variables from the request context. Variable names in a single pattern must be
unique.

Matches are ordinarily delimited by slashes ("/"), but several other characters
are accepted as delimiters (with slightly different semantics): the period
("."), semicolon (";"), and comma (",") characters. For instance, given the
pattern "/:file.:ext", the request "/data.json" would match, binding "file" to
"data" and "ext" to "json". Note that these special characters are treated
slightly differently than slashes: the above pattern also matches the path
"/data.tar.gz", with "ext" getting set to "tar.gz"; and the pattern "/:file"
matches names with dots in them (like "data.json").


Prefix Matches

Pat can also match prefixes of routes using wildcards. Prefix wildcard routes
end with "/*", and match just the path segments preceding the asterisk. For
instance, the pattern "/user/*" will match "/user/" and "/user/carl/photos" but
not "/user" (note the lack of a trailing slash).

The unmatched suffix, including the leading slash ("/"), are placed into the
request context, which allows subsequent routing (e.g., a subrouter) to continue
from where this pattern left off. For instance, in the "/user/*" pattern from
above, a request for "/user/carl/photos" will consume the "/user" prefix,
leaving the path "/carl/photos" for subsequent patterns to handle. A subrouter
pattern for "/:name/photos" would match this remaining path segment, for
instance.
